# Eggroll's Police System
This project is designed to overhaul the policing system in the Garry's Mod DarkRP gamemode. It has been worked on on and off for a few years now (even before it was published to this repository).

This project is somewhat functional, but has some bugs and is missing a lot of planned features, as highlighted in the repository's issues section. The UI also needs to be redesigned.

ðŸš§ Consider this project as abandoned. ðŸš§
