Any files named with the prefix cl_, sv_, or sh_ will be included and AddCSLuaFile'd accordingly.

A program must have be registered in the client realm with EggrollPoliceSystem:RegisterProgram( name, program_table ). Registering a program in the server realm is optional.

Programs can be de-registered with EggrollPoliceSystem:DeRegisterProgram( name ).

Icon positions are in { x, y } format and is recommended to be offset by 50 in the x-direction and/or 60 in the y-direction for each program per row/column starting from { 40, 60 }.

PROGRAM:Init( ) (client) is required.

PROGRAM:Close( ) (client) is optional.

PROGRAM:Init( ) (server) is optional.

PROGRAM:Close( ) (server) is optional.

PROGRAM.ProgramFrame is set before the program initializes and is the VGUI frame of the program.

Each program has its own instance on each computer, similar to how scripted entities work.

Example Program Below:

Client:

local PROGRAM = { }
PROGRAM.Name = "Test Program"
PROGRAM.Icon = "icon16/box.png"
PROGRAM.IconPosition = { 25, 60 }

function PROGRAM:Init( computer ) -- Called when the program is opened.
	self.ProgramFrame.WindowBackgroundColor = Color( 20, 20, 20 )

	-- REMOVE BELOW LATER

	local ToBeImplemented = vgui.Create( "DLabel", self.ProgramFrame )
	ToBeImplemented:SetFont( "EPSTitleLoginFont" )
	ToBeImplemented:SetTextColor( Color( 200, 200, 200 ) )
	ToBeImplemented:SetText( "To Be Implemented" )
	ToBeImplemented:SizeToContents( )
	ToBeImplemented:CenterHorizontal( 0.5 )
	ToBeImplemented:CenterVertical( 0.5 )
end

function PROGRAM:Close( ) -- Called right before the program is closed.
end

EggrollPoliceSystem:RegisterProgram( PROGRAM.Name, PROGRAM )

Server:

local PROGRAM = { }
PROGRAM.Name = "Test Program"

function PROGRAM:Init( user, computer ) -- Called when the program is opened.
end

function PROGRAM:Close( ) -- Called right after the program is closed.
end

EggrollPoliceSystem:RegisterProgram( PROGRAM.Name, PROGRAM )
